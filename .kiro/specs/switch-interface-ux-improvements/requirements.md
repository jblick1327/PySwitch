# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the Switch Interface's out-of-the-box user experience by addressing critical usability issues that prevent users from successfully using the application on first launch. The improvements target first-run experience, error handling, default configurations, and user guidance to make the assistive technology more accessible and reliable for users with disabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user with disabilities, I want to successfully launch and use the Switch Interface on my first attempt, so that I can immediately benefit from the assistive technology without technical barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user launches the application for the first time THEN the system SHALL provide a streamlined setup process with clear instructions
2. WHEN the audio calibration fails THEN the system SHALL offer a "Skip Calibration" option with sensible defaults
3. WHEN no microphone is detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on how to connect or configure audio devices
4. WHEN the setup wizard encounters any error THEN the system SHALL allow the user to retry or continue with default settings
5. IF the user chooses to skip calibration THEN the system SHALL use pre-configured sensitivity settings that work for most users

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of assistive technology, I want access to production-ready keyboard layouts, so that I can effectively communicate without having to create custom layouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the layout selection THEN the system SHALL provide at least one complete QWERTY layout with all essential keys
2. WHEN the user selects the default layout THEN the system SHALL load a comprehensive layout including letters, numbers, punctuation, and common actions
3. WHEN the user needs a simplified interface THEN the system SHALL offer a basic alphabet layout for beginners
4. WHEN the user wants to type efficiently THEN the system SHALL provide layouts with predictive text capabilities
5. IF no custom layout is specified THEN the system SHALL default to the most comprehensive available layout

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user experiencing technical difficulties, I want clear error messages and recovery options, so that I can resolve issues independently without requiring technical support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs during startup THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with specific troubleshooting steps
2. WHEN the launcher encounters an error THEN the system SHALL remain open to allow the user to try different settings
3. WHEN audio device access fails THEN the system SHALL suggest specific solutions like checking connections or trying calibration
4. WHEN an unexpected error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed information while showing simplified messages to users
5. IF the system cannot start normally THEN the system SHALL offer a safe mode or minimal functionality option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with varying technical skills, I want comprehensive documentation and guidance, so that I can understand how to use the Switch Interface effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs help getting started THEN the system SHALL provide a clear getting-started guide with step-by-step instructions
2. WHEN a user encounters problems THEN the system SHALL offer a troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
3. WHEN a user wants to customize layouts THEN the system SHALL provide documentation on creating and modifying keyboard layouts
4. WHEN a user needs technical details THEN the system SHALL provide environment setup instructions for different operating systems
5. IF a user is unfamiliar with switch-access technology THEN the system SHALL explain the basic concepts and usage patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with specific accessibility needs, I want configurable default settings and scanning options, so that the interface works well for my particular requirements without extensive customization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first launches the application THEN the system SHALL use scanning speeds appropriate for new users (slower, more forgiving timing)
2. WHEN the user wants to adjust scanning speed THEN the system SHALL provide preset options including "slow", "medium", "fast", and "very fast"
3. WHEN the user has motor difficulties THEN the system SHALL offer longer dwell times by default to reduce accidental activations
4. WHEN the user becomes more proficient THEN the system SHALL allow easy adjustment to faster scanning speeds
5. IF the user's needs change over time THEN the system SHALL remember and persist their preferred settings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who relies on assistive technology, I want the application to gracefully handle hardware failures and provide fallback options, so that I can continue using the interface even when my primary input method has issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the primary audio device fails THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt to use alternative available devices
2. WHEN exclusive audio mode is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to shared mode without user intervention
3. WHEN switch detection becomes unreliable THEN the system SHALL offer recalibration options without requiring a full restart
4. WHEN the user's hardware configuration changes THEN the system SHALL detect and adapt to the new setup
5. IF all audio input fails THEN the system SHALL offer alternative input methods or clear instructions for hardware troubleshooting
