# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The auto-calibration feature needs to be more reliable and robust for ablenet style switches. The current auto-calibration sometimes fails or produces suboptimal results, requiring users to fall back to manual calibration. This improvement focuses on making auto-calibration work consistently with ablenet switches across different audio setups.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want auto-calibration to work reliably on the first attempt with my ablenet switch, so that I don't have to retry multiple times or fall back to manual calibration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-calibration is initiated with an ablenet switch THEN the system SHALL successfully detect and calibrate switch presses with 95% reliability
2. WHEN auto-calibration fails on first attempt THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with adjusted parameters before reporting failure
3. WHEN auto-calibration completes THEN the system SHALL validate the results and only accept configurations that pass quality checks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during auto-calibration, so that I know what to do and when the process is complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-calibration starts THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions on how many switch presses are needed
2. WHEN the user is pressing the switch THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback showing detected presses
3. WHEN auto-calibration completes THEN the system SHALL display the results and confidence level of the calibration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want auto-calibration to work with different audio devices, so that I can use whatever microphone or audio interface I have available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using different audio devices THEN auto-calibration SHALL automatically adjust its algorithms for device characteristics
2. WHEN background noise is present THEN auto-calibration SHALL filter out noise and focus on ablenet switch signals
3. WHEN sample rates vary between devices THEN auto-calibration SHALL adapt its detection parameters accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want auto-calibration to recover gracefully from errors, so that I can complete the setup process even if there are temporary issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio device access fails THEN the system SHALL try alternative devices automatically
2. WHEN signal quality is poor THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on improving the ablenet switch setup
3. WHEN calibration produces questionable results THEN the system SHALL warn the user and offer to retry with different parameters

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want auto-calibration results to be as accurate as manual calibration, so that I don't sacrifice detection quality for convenience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-calibration completes THEN the resulting thresholds SHALL provide accurate ablenet switch detection
2. WHEN ablenet switch presses are detected during normal use THEN false positive rate SHALL be less than 1%
3. WHEN ablenet switch presses occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL correctly detect all presses without missing any due to debounce issues
